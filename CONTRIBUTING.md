# Contribution Rules üìë

- Do read the `readme.md` file.

- Do NOT create a pull request until the issue created is accepted ‚úî and you're assigned to that issue.

- Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts.

- Do NOT work on more than one issue at a time, so you don't make a huge pull request and others can have opportunities to work on another issue while you work on something else.

- Add the Issue you worked on in your Pull Request.

- Do NOT work on the main branch; create your own branch by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/vin-jex/dent-clack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started).

- Fill out issue and pull request (PR) templates properly. If you don't know how, check out previous issues to see how they are filled or just ask. :)

## Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! If you have an idea, please open an issue on GitHub and describe:
- The problem your feature would solve.

- Any additional context or details.

## Submitting Changes

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that:
1. Your code follows our [Style Guidelines](#style-guidelines).
2. You have written tests for your changes, if applicable.
3. All tests pass and the code lints without errors.
4. Your commit messages follow our [Commit Messages](#commit-messages) guidelines.

## Style Guidelines

- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with some exceptions for TypeScript.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write clear and concise comments where necessary.
- Ensure code readability and maintainability.

### Linting and Formatting

We use ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. Ensure your code passes both before committing:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
# or
yarn lint
yarn format
```

## Commit Messages

Please write descriptive commit messages that clearly explain the purpose of your changes. Follow these guidelines:
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Be concise but descriptive.
- Reference any relevant issues or pull requests.

### Example Commit Messages

- `Fix: Fix typo in README`
- `Feat: Add user authentication feature`
- `Refactor: Refactor header component for better readability`
- `Style: Style header component for satisfying feeling`
- `Perf: Update dependencies to latest versions`

## Avoid Conflicts üèì {Syncing your fork}

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PRs may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.

```terminal
git remote add upstream https://github.com/vin-jex/dent-clack
```

Verify if the new remote has been added by running the command:

```terminal
git remote -v
```

To pull any new changes from your parent repo simply run:

```terminal
git merge upstream/main
```

This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.

For more information on syncing forks, [read this article from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).

üèÜ After this, the maintainers will review the PR and merge it if it helps move the Code-Magic project forward. Otherwise, it will be given constructive feedback and suggestions for the changes needed to add the PR to the codebase.
